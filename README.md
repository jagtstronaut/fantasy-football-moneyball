Optimizing fantasy football draft picks with projected points. This repo will contain some fun tools to help you optimize your fantasy football picks. The theory is that if you pick the position that has the largest potential to drop in projected points between your draft turns you will end with a higher potential point total then if you take a greedy algorith or feelings based approach. 

Some notes:
1. In a mockdraft, this only outperforms a greedy algorithm by a couple of projected points so take this for what it is.
2. This is optimized for snakedraft and numbers in the spreadsheet are for the 2025 NFL season.
3. I have never won a fantasy football league and participated in very few.
