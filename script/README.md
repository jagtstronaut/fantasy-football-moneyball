I am a firm beleiver that excel should drive every person to learn to program (this is actually what pushed me to teach myself to code). So, V2 of the fantasy-football-moneyball is a python script. Functions the same as the spreadsheet version, but the annoying parts are automated for you. 

*Instructions to use the script*
- Run the script
- 1 to show all top 5 available players.
- 2 to show the top 5 players from a specific sheet.
- 3 to remove a player by their last name when another person drafts them.
- 4 to draft a player for your team.
- 5 to update the number of players at each position that will be drafted before your next turn.
- 6 to show a summary that will help you make your pick.
- 7 to quit the script.

*List of "Don't judge me this is a fantasy football side project"*
- Yes, this is vibecoded to infinity and beyond (thank you cursor).
- Yes, I am using excel as a database we all make poor decisions sometimes.
- Yes, the GUI is a CLI. I am a backend programmer and to us there is no greater user interface.
