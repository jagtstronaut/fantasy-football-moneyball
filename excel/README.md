This spreadsheet is designed to help you optimize your picks for the highest points and by avoiding the most potential points lost between this pick and your next pick. 

*How to use this spreadsheet*
* The spreadsheet is to help you pick your starters and one sub per position (my league has a super flex so I have an extra sub for QB). 
* Use the Decision Matrix as a dashboard to make your pick.
  * Change the slip cell to the number of players that you think are going to be taken at that position before your next pick.
  * Top player is the player with the highest projected points available to pick.
  * Lower player is best player you can get on your next pick if you are right about the slip.
  * The only cell you will have to update manually is My Squad
* Delete a player's row from the appropriate sheet to update the spreadsheet as picks are made.

*Notes*
- Excel won't let you reference a cell and then delete the row. Instead of updating with whatever value is now in the cell, it breaks all the formulas. That is why I had to do that nonsense with the vlookup and the counter.
- This reminded me how much more I like programming than excel.
